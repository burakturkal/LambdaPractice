@Builder in Lombok makes it easier to make instances.
 - When you use the builder, you don't have to use AllArgConstructor, because it already builds it unless there is
   another @XConstructor. If you have one of them, then Builder won't build it. That's why we don't use it very
   often in development, because we always need a no arg constructor.

   inventory.add(new Orange(300,AppleTask.Color.GREEN)); --> Instead of this
   inventory.add(Orange.builder().weight(200).color(AppleTask.Color.GREEN).build()); --> We can use this

@Data is the shortcut of @Getter, setter, toString

Collections always accepts objects. Even when you pass integer, you pass Wrapper class
